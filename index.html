            <p>Hello! Welcome to my personal website and portfolio. Here you can find the 
                projects I have completed for academic, work-related and personal projects. 
                 Most of them are GIS related as I have experience using ArcGIS, 
                 QGIS and Google Earth Engine. Use the navigaton bar at the top of the 
                 screen to learn more about me and my projects.

                        <h1> Mapping Underutilized Land in Seattle </h1>
                        <h2> Senior Capstone Project produced in collaboration with House Our Neighbors </h2>
                        <br>
                        <p>     
                        I completed this project during the spring quarter of my senior 
                        year at the University of Washington. My team collaborated with House Our Neighbors, a 
                        Seattle based nonprofit organization advocating for social housing which is affordable, 
                        publicly owned and mixed-income for all. Over the course of this project my team developed 
                        interactive GIS maps and data dashboards using ArcGIS and SQL to run queries in order to 
                        filter through a large, messy dataset for parcel-level information. We were tasked 
                        with identifying underutilized parcels in Seattle suitable for new social 
                        housing development, with metrics like access to various forms of transportation 
                        in mind. The project involved extensive land zoning research and data compilation,
                        drawing from various local agencies' open data portals to build our own interactive 
                        maps, dashboards and data visualizations. The created material is being used to help 
                        House Our Neighbors advocate for greater social housing development and opportunities 
                        in Seattle.
