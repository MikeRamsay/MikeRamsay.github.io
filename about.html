                <p>
                My name is Mike Ramsay, I graduated from the University of Washington in June 2025 with a degree 
                in Geography: Data Science and a minor in Informatics. I am passionate about GIS and mapping technologies, 
                transportation, mobility solutions and the application of sustainable practices to our infrastructure and 
                supply chain networks. Currently, I am seeking a post-grad employment opportunity. I am eager to apply my 
                skills and open to developing new skills as well. My background and experience is made up of primarily 
                mapping and data science projects from various academic projects I completed during my undergrad. One of 
                the larger and more recent projects I completed was in collaboration with House Our Neighbors (HON), a 
                Seattle based nonprofit organization advocating for social housing which is affordable, publicly owned 
                and mixed-income for all. My team and I utilized programs such as ArcGIS, QGIS and SQL to develop a series 
                of interactive maps and data dashboards for HON. We were tasked with identifying underutilized parcels 
                which followed a series of qualifying metrics, like access to transportation, proximity to schools and 
                more, which deemed them suitable for new social housing development. The project involved extensive land 
                zoning research and data analysis with SQL as we utilized various local agencies' open data portals to 
                build our own interactive maps, dashboards and data visualizations. This experience helped improve my 
                ability to perform data analysis and spatial reporting. It also reinforced the importance of maintaining 
                accurate and accessible public information to support equity-based decision making surrounding complex 
                issues, like the housing affordability crisis.

                I also completed a year-long internship in July 2025 with the City of Seattle. I worked in the Solid 
                Waste Division at Seattle Public Utilities where I was able to gain lots of hands-on experience in 
                program implementation and data coordination. One of my main contributions to my team was the role I 
                played in helping launch and operate the Reuse Seattle Program, supplying over 30 events around Seattle 
                with reusable dishware during the summer of 2024. These efforts displacing tens of thousands of single 
                use dishware and packaging from entering the waste stream. And I continued to help expand the program 
                this past year, including my own activation project for the use of reusable cups at running races in 
                Seattle. I got to handle the entire process of brainstorming and researching a topic to identify local 
                running organizations who could benefit from this program. I then found a company which could supply us 
                with reusable silicone cups and coordinated the ordering and purchasing process with them. During the 
                first race, 1,315 reusable cups were used, significantly reducing single-use waste generated by the 
                event. This has continued to be part of the Reuse Seattle program after my internship ended. Overall, 
                I gained lots of professional experience as I frequently collaborate across departments and with various 
                local businesses. This strengthened my ability to work effectively in a diverse, team-oriented environment 
                with sustainability in mind.

                During the last two years of my undergrad I served as the vice president of the Husky Running Club on 
                the University of Washington Seattle campus. This provided me with some valuable leadership experience. 
                I was responsible for managing and keeping track of the clubâ€™s financial transactions. I also helped plan 
                social events for the club throughout the year, like our yearly outing to a Mariners Game, and organizing 
                our annual PAWS Charity 5k. During the two years that I served as vice president we raised over $3,000 
                from PAWS to be used for race entry fees, purchasing new materials for the club. Over half of these 
                earnings were donated to United In Stride, an organization which helps provide guides for blind or low 
                vision runners. Some of the other organizations I was involved with on campus were the United UW Cultural 
                Exchange Program, GeoDat Geography Research Club and the Cycle Club on campus.

                I plan on continuing to develop and grow my skillset during my post-grad life with my own personal 
                projects, like creating this website which really helped me get a refresher on using HTML and CSS.
