                        <p> 
                            I created this prototype app for a design-a-thon event with the UX @ UW Club. My 
                            team and I used Figma over the course of the two-day design-a-thon. The app allows 
                            users to track the perishable items in their fridge or pantry and donate any unwanted 
                            or excess items to help minimize food waste. The basic functionality of the app 
                            consists of the ability to scan and manually add items to the app’s “digital pantry”. 
                            Once the expiration date is imputed for an item, the app keeps track of it and notifies 
                            the user when it reaches its expiration date. Once an item has reached its listed 
                            expiration date, the user can either keep it or donate it to local food banks as they 
                            still accept many items past their “best before” dates. The app also has a grocery 
                            list and food planning functions to reduce the amount of excess food the user is buying 
                            and create meals based on which ingredients are available. My team ended up being one 
                            of the finalists and presented our project to a panel of judges at the end of the competition.
