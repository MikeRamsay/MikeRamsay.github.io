                            I completed this project when I took the intro to computer-aided design class in the 
                            mechanical engineering department at the University of Washington. Throughout the quarter 
                            I learned how to use Solidworks, a CAD software. This was the final project, designed to 
                            showcase the skills that I had learned throughout the quarter. I decided to design, build 
                            and assemble the pipe frame kart from Mario Kart. For this project, I utilized a series of reference planes, 
                            shells, feature patterns, mechanical mates. The most difficult part was designing the frame which uses a 
                            series of sweeps to achieve the stacked pipe element. To the right is the assembly file which 
                            showcases the various pieces that I designed and mated together to build the final kart.
