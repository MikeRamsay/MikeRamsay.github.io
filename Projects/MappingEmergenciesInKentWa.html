                            The main focus of this lab was to map Kent Fire Department’s emergency calls by creating heatmaps for each 
                            type of emergency. These maps were produced in ArcGIS utilizing the spatial analyst kernel density 
                            geoprocessing tool and contour polyline datasets were added to help visualize the distribution of calls. 
                            As far as the spatial differences there are hotspots in every around downtown Kent and the neighboring 
                            East Hill neighborhood. This makes sense spatially since these regions, especially downtown Kent, are the 
                            most densely populated regions and contain lots of commercial and office buildings which attract lots of 
                            people during the day. Breaking the data into different classes (emergency types) can provide some valuable 
                            insight into where different emergencies are occurring and is usually heavily linked to local infastructure 
                            and city zoning. The kernel density and contour interval map combination can help visualize these emergency 
                            call data points in a more clear and concise manner by limiting overcrowding of data points and improving 
                            the map’s overall readability.
