                        <h2> Project Summary </h2>
                        <p> 
                            The purpose of our project was to work collaboratively with 
                            <a href="https://www.houseourneighbors.org/"> House Our Neighbors</a> to identify underutilized land for 
                            future social housing development in Seattle. House our Neighbors is a Seattle based nonprofit organization 
                            advocating for social housing which is affordable, publicly owned and mixed-income for all. They have 
                            campaigned for passing Initiative 135 in 2023 which established Seattle Social Housing Developer, a public 
                            development authority to develop, own, lease and maintain mixed-income housing affordable for all and owned 
                            as a public asset forever. They also helped pass Prop 1A in February 2025 which was an excessive compensation 
                            tax to fund the Seattle Social Housing Developer. They do not believe that the free-market and just allowing 
                            more housing to be built will solve the housing crisis. Rather, a strong public housing sector must be created 
                            to challenge the private market which is what they are trying to achieve. Social housing is differentiated 
                            from affordable housing in the sense that it is housing designated for people of all backgrounds, incomes, 
                            etc and remains a public good in perpetuity. 
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            For this project, we defined underutilized land as parcels with 
                            greater than 90% appraised land value and those classified as vacant or for gas station or parking use. All 
                            identified parcels are already zoned for single-family, multi-family and commercial construction. All of the 
                            data collected and used for this analysis is open source from various open data portals from government 
                            agencies in Washington, along with a publicly available GitHub repository and school information from the 
                            non-profit, Great Schools. This made up the most intensive portion of the project, consisting of 
                            lots of research, data collection and cleaning before maps and visualizations could be put together. 
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            After the 
                            data was cleaned, queries were run and analysis was conducted, we identified a total of 5,587 underutilized 
                            parcels within Seattleâ€™s city limits, totaling to 1,182 acres with an average lot size of 0.21 acres. These 
                            numbers demonstrate that Seattle has the capacity to act decisively, provided political will aligns with 
                            policy goals, to significantly expand housing and address the city's housing crisis.
