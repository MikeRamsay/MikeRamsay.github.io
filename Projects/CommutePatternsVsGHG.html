                            The goal of this project was to visualize the relationship between commute patterns and greenhouse 
                            gas emissions in the Puget Sound Region with Mapbox. With the intent of exploring the impact that 
                            different forms of transportation have on emissions and to explore what this data tells us about 
                            the land use in Seattle. In terms of data used, I ended up using two datasets - both from The 
                            Washington Department of Transportation. One contains line data with 2019 average annual daily 
                            traffic (AADT) volumes across Washingtonâ€™s State Highway system. The other contains data from 
                            Washington State Employee Commute Trip Reduction Survey which is an initiative to reduce traffic 
                            and air pollution in the state by shifting solo-driving commutes to alternative forms of 
                            transportation. This provided the average daily GHG emissions produced per employee. The final 
                            result was a story map with the AADT value data and GHG emissions per employee choropleth map.
