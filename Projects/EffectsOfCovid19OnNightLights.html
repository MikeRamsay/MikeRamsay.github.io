                        <h2> Project Summary </h2>
                        <p> 
                            For this project I used Google Earth Engine and the night time light (NTL) VIIRS satellite data 
                            available on the platform. I ran a script to filter the NTL data from a select the date ranges. 
                            I compared the pre-Covid data (2018) with light light data during and post-Covid (2023). The 
                            imagery uses the average radiance band, or the average radiance for each pixel is taken for the 
                            time period. It's clear from the map that the majority of the night sky across the US was darker 
                            during the pandemic. This was the case for the 2018 vs 2020 map as well. However, one region 
                            that has consistently decreased in brightness from 2018 through 2020 to 2023 are the oil fields in 
                            North Dakota. This is most likely due to the fact that the Biden Administration suspended new oil 
                            and gas leases on federal land during his first couple days in office to combat climate change 
                            (Yang, 2021). The legend was also created using the script editor in Google Earth Engine.
