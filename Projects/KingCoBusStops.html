                            This was one of the first GIS projects I completed while utilizing QGIS. I was curious to see if there 
                            is a correlation between the availability of public transportation and the general socioeconomic status 
                            of different regions across Seattle. This is an important topic as transportation disproportionately 
                            impacts people without personal vehicles, who are usually lower income and have less transit options 
                            available. This is also a huge reason why we need high quality and affordable public transportation 
                            options available to everyone in Seattle. In order to visualize this project I created two maps, one 
                            being a choropleth map with the percentage of households below the poverty line across the different 
                            Seattle census tracts along with the locations of bus stops from King County Metro’s open data portal. 
                            The other map, to the left, was created using QGIS’s buffer analysis and clipping operations to create 
                            distance buffers around the bus stops to get a better idea of how coverage differs around Seattle. 
                            Between the two maps, there is a clear difference between North and South Seattle in terms of bus stop 
                            coverage and percentage of households below the poverty line. I believe that further analysis would be 
                            beneficial in order to confirm these beliefs but it’s clear that there is a disparity.
