                            This was the main project I worked on during my internship with the City of Seattle. This was 
                            essentially an extension of the Reuse Seattle Program, which I helped launch during the summer 
                            of 2024. The main emphasis of this program is to incentivise local businesses, event organizers 
                            and organizations to shift away from using single use food and dishware projects and to reusables 
                            instead. I was responsible for identifying a sector which could benefit from the implementation of 
                            reusables. I then conducted some research and identified a company which makes reusable silicone cups, 
                            designed for run and walk events. I got in contact with the business owner and we were able to 
                            purchase 5,000 cups from them to use in Seattleâ€™s own Reuse Program. This first race involved a 
                            partnership with Run for Good and Friends of the Waterfront to activate the use of reusable silicone 
                            cups at their Waterfront 5k on May 31st. For this race 1,315 cups were used, significantly reducing 
                            single-use waste generated by the event. The cups were then cleaned and used at future races around 
                            the city.
