                        <p> 
                            This project explored the populations in Los Angeles at the greatest risk at becoming homeless and some 
                            of the risk factors associated with them. A series of maps and charts were created to visualize these 
                            statistics. 
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>
                            For the risk map, to the left, a target or “worst case” tract was created by isolating a single polygon 
                            tract and adding all of the worst case values to its attribute table. The similarity tool was used to 
                            determine how close the other tracts were to these values and with some editing of the symbology, the 
                            areas at higher risks for generating new homelessness were highlighted. I would say that this is an 
                            overall effective method for determining high risk areas, especially with population being factored 
                            in with the adjustments in transparency. This ensures that larger, more rural tracts, which may have 
                            smaller populations, are properly visualized in comparison to smaller tracts with larger populations 
                            around Downtown LA for example. 
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>
                            The prioritizing prevention visualization (to the right) focuses on metrics that are most likely to contribute 
                            the most to creating larger homeless populations. Graduated symbol maps are good for easily visualizing these 
                            hotspots, as seen with the mapping of the unemployment and rent burdened fields. While it can be hard 
                            to determine the exact bin or amount the symbols are categorized in when using these types of maps, 
                            they are still good at highlighting the general hotspots. The separation of the different fields 
                            allows for unique targeted intervention strategies for each region.

                            The above charts showcase some of the more indepth statistics that can be generated with ArcGIS. They explore 
                            the total homeless populations broken down by community, greatest risk factors and types of shelters 
                            in some selected neighborhoods. The highlighted neighborhoods can easily be altered by editing which 
                            are selected in the attribute table.
