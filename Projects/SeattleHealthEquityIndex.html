                        <p> 
                            For this project, the primary focuses were creating an index in ArcGIS and equity mapping which is the 
                            process of identifying disparities in access to resources or outcomes across a population. There are many 
                            benefits that can be drawn from this form of spatial analysis. One of the main benefits are the potential 
                            improvements to resource allocation by identifying areas that are in the most need of funds or services. 
                            To the right is the final composite index map I made with the composite index tool in ArcGIS. I weighted 
                            the Health 8 variable (percent of insured civilian noninstitutionalized population) by a factor of 2x 
                            compared to the other variables which included the percentage of; adults with a disability, adults 
                            reporting mental health as not good, adults with obesity and life expectancy at birth. 
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            In response to this change in weight factor, most census tract regions grew darker or moved up in equity 
                            score - which is not a good thing in this case. These changes are most apparent around Northgate and in 
                            the south in the Rainier Valley region as seen in the map below. That means this variable impacts the 
                            equity index across the city the most due to large proportions of the population not being insured. 
                            However, interestingly enough, one region that actually saw a reduction in equity score was West Seattle.
