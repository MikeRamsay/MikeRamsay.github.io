                            This lab utilizes General Transit feed Specification (GTFS) schedule data from King County Metro courtesy 
                            of Sound Transit. The goal was to highlight areas underserved the greatest and compare it to demographic 
                            data to get a better picture of where in the city has the greatest need for public transit expansion. This 
                            was achieved with some buffer analysis, masking and the Census Block Groups data within ArcGIS. 
                            The data used includes three key variables that influence accessibility level needs around the city. Those 
                            being population density, households below the poverty line and households without access to a personal vehicle.

                            Regions with higher numbers of households below the poverty line and without access to vehicles as well as 
                            higher population densities are highlighted on both maps I created. The map on the left includes the service 
                            area within a 10 minute walk in blue and individual bus stop locations around the city. The map to the right 
                            highlights the underserved regions around the city, there are quite a few around Rainier Valley and White 
                            Center as well as around Northgate. Figure 3 above showcases the counts of each population and the 
                            share/count of that population that is not within 10 minute access to a transit stop.
