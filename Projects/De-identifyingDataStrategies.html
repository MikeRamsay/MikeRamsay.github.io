                        <p> 
                            The goal of this project was to explore various de-indentification mapping 
                            methods within ArcGIS. This is process also called geomasking which is 
                            the process of altering the location of data 
                            in an unpredictable way through the use of algorithms. These methods are 
                            primarily used when dealing with sensitive geospatial data, such as sensitive 
                            information on a patient’s overall health or treatment they are undergoing. 
                            The need to separate the identifiable information from an individual’s sensitive 
                            information is becoming increasingly important as more of our information is 
                            being digitized in an increasingly polarized world. On the right are some of 
                            the various methods I explored in this project. These include the heatmap (b) 
                            and point cluster (d) methods, which . However, one issue with these methods 
                            is at smaller scales the individual points become more visible. One way to 
                            avoid this is with hexbins (a) which does not identify individual points. The 
                            rounded coordinated map (c) also achieves this however it can over-simplify 
                            the data at times. More in-depth analysis is in my report linked below.
